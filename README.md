## Description
My motivation was to push myself to get better at JS. This language was more complex than Html and CSS and I hoped to have demonstrated skills I learned from this lesson. This is a password generator that can give you characters which limits you from 8-128 characters. They can include numbers, lower and uppercase alphabets, and special characters.
## Installation

N/A

## Usage
Once you press the generate button you will recieve prompts that will generate random characters. Many can benefit using this generatorm, to have a securer password.
